To-Do:
When login / register is pressed
Close button "x"
user is from username input
Verfication code post request and retireve error parse json into screen output (failure is a useState[]) (linked to onsubmit on login / register panel forms)
can only create popups if logged in (after username created)
log out = onClick setUser(null)
Send on yt about the vid that I used maptiler instead and code repository found in my github

Issues:

Maybe solution:
(Isolation of pieces)

Future idea:
A way to test code or ideas by placing popups around a drawboard
