To-Do:

make warning message pretty in authen css

- cookies local cache or smth


user is from username input => setUser(name) => can only create popups if logged in nearly there

Send on yt about the vid that I used maptiler instead and code repository found in my github

Issues:
click(tom) adel -> tom
click(tom) tom -> view popup
- the title taking time to be set 
so the old title is used when POST request sent, then the new title is set

Maybe solution:
- useEffect for title, pointDesc new values
- form.onsubmit > is a useState flag (false/true)
- if useState flag is true, then the new title and pointDesc 
are used thru post request (SOLUTION HAS WORKED!!!) => problem is lag




(Isolation of pieces) understand flow

Future idea:

A way to test code or ideas by placing popups around a drawboard
