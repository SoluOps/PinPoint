To-Do:


user is from username input
onclose similar thing > values
deal with return json data
Verfication code post request and retireve error parse json into screen output (failure is a useState[]) (linked to onsubmit on login / register panel forms)

log out = onClick setUser(null)

user is from username input => setUser(name) => can only create popups if logged in 

Send on yt about the vid that I used maptiler instead and code repository found in my github

Issues:


Maybe solution:

(Isolation of pieces) understand flow

Future idea:

A way to test code or ideas by placing popups around a drawboard
