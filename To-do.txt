To-Do:

make warning message pretty in authen css

- cookies local cache or smth


Send on yt about the vid that I used maptiler instead and code repository found in my github

Issues:
- cannot close popup :(

Maybe solution:
- current point that is made togglePopup so that it closes form popup and shows what they added
- if last points[p] = last position then add marker and togglePopup


Worked Solution:
- useEffect for title, pointDesc new values
- form.onsubmit > is a useState flag (false/true)
- if useState flag is true, then the new title and pointDesc 
are used thru post request (SOLUTION HAS WORKED!!!) => problem is lag




(Isolation of pieces) understand flow

Future idea:

A way to test code or ideas by placing popups around a drawboard
